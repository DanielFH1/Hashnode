This post is a summary based on the book **"An Introduction to Quantum Computers"** by Shuntaro Takeda. In this article, "QC" refers to "Quantum Computer."

# üß† Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a revolutionary field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

## ‚ö° Speed and Efficiency

While quantum computers aren't universally faster than classical computers, they excel in specific tasks:

* **Parallelism:** Qubits can represent multiple states at once, allowing quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities simultaneously.
    
* **Problem-Solving:** They're particularly effective in solving complex problems like factoring large numbers or simulating molecular structures.
    

## üìâ Motivation: Moore's Law and the New Paradigm

Until now, the strategy has been to reduce the size of transistors in order to fit more onto a limited surface area, utilizing techniques like EUV lithography to integrate them using lasers. However, we have reached the limit of shrinking semiconductor transistor sizes. As transistors continue to get smaller, they are reaching atomic-scale sizes, making it physically impossible to reduce them further. Additionally, as the size of transistors approaches that of atoms, we enter the realm of quantum mechanics. This leads to the issue of quantum tunneling, where unwanted currents begin to leak due to the transistor's quantum effects, causing the problem of leakage current to become increasingly severe. As a result, quantum computers are being presented as a potential solution.

## üß™ Practical Applications

Quantum computing holds promise in various domains:

* **Cryptography:** Breaking traditional encryption methods and developing quantum-resistant algorithms.
    
* **Drug Discovery:** Simulating molecular interactions to expedite the development of new medications.
    
* **Optimization:** Enhancing logistics, such as optimizing delivery routes or supply chain management.
    

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges in Implementation

Despite its potential, quantum computing faces significant hurdles:

* **Decoherence:** Qubits are sensitive to environmental disturbances, leading to loss of information.
    
* **Error Correction:** Developing methods to detect and correct errors without disturbing the quantum state is complex.
    
* **Scalability:** Building systems with a large number of stable qubits remains a significant challenge.
