# Quantum Computers: Principles, Implementations, and the Future of Humanity

*Comprehensive Review by Seungwoo Lim*  
*(Based on Michio Kaku’s “Quantum Supremacy” and the latest research & applications)*

## Abstract

This article provides a comprehensive overview of quantum computers, covering their fundamental principles (coherence/decoherence, many-worlds interpretation), diverse applications (cryptography, AI, energy, medicine, longevity, climate, space), implementation technologies (superconducting, ion trap, photonic, topological, etc.), and philosophical debates. By synthesizing recent case studies-such as Shor’s algorithm, QKD, Haber-Bosch process, cancer therapy, and nuclear fusion simulation-it analyzes the transformative impact quantum computers may have on the future of humanity.

## 1\. Introduction

Quantum computers, first proposed by Richard Feynman in 1982, are emerging as next-generation technologies poised to solve humanity’s grand challenges in computation, cryptography, energy, medicine, AI, and climate. This article explores quantum mechanics interpretations, real-world applications, implementation technologies, and philosophical debates in a comprehensive manner.

## 2\. Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Philosophy

### 2.1 Copenhagen Interpretation vs. Many-Worlds Interpretation

The Copenhagen interpretation posits that the wave function collapses upon observation, yielding a single reality. In contrast, Hugh Everett’s many-worlds interpretation asserts that all possibilities branch into parallel universes. Like tuning a radio, realities exist whether or not we perceive them.

* Why don’t we experience parallel universes?
    
* Is the probability of moving to another universe truly negligible?
    

These debates profoundly influence our understanding of information and reality in quantum computing.

## 3\. Principles and Speed of Quantum Computers

### 3.1 Coherence and Decoherence

A qubit can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1, and entangled qubits can process (2^n) states simultaneously. Quantum computers function only while coherence is preserved; decoherence, caused by environmental interaction, disrupts this state. Extending coherence time is thus a central research goal. For example, superconducting qubits are stabilized by extreme cooling to prolong coherence.

#### 3.1.1 Coherence and Decoherence Anecdote

Einstein’s EPR paradox: If entangled electrons are separated across the universe and one’s spin is set, the other’s must instantly change. This “spooky action at a distance” appears to violate relativity. Experiments show that while entanglement enables instantaneous state changes, usable information cannot be transmitted faster than light.

### 3.2 Shor’s Algorithm and Security

Shor’s algorithm reduces the complexity of integer factorization (the basis of RSA cryptography) from (O(2^N)) to (O(N^n)), threatening modern cryptosystems and trapdoor functions. To prepare for quantum computers, increasing RSA key sizes and developing more complex trapdoor functions are suggested. New security paradigms such as quantum key distribution (QKD) are emerging.

## 4\. Applications of Quantum Computers

### 4.1 Energy & Chemistry Revolution

The **Haber-Bosch process** converts atmospheric nitrogen ((N\_2)) and hydrogen ((H\_2)) into ammonia ((NH\_3)), solving global food shortages but consuming 2% of global electricity and emitting 400 million tons of CO(\_2) annually. Quantum computers enable virtual chemistry experiments to rapidly discover better catalysts and improve energy efficiency.

| Energy Source | Energy Density (MJ/kg) | CO(\_2) Emissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gasoline | 46.4 | High |
| Lithium-ion Battery | 0.46 | Low |
| Nuclear Fusion (theoretical) | 340,000,000 | None |

**Nuclear fusion** offers limitless fuel (hydrogen) and zero emissions. Quantum computers can simulate plasma control and fusion stability, enabling calculations beyond classical computers.

### 4.2 Medicine, Longevity, and Disease Conquest

In **cancer therapy**, quantum molecular simulations accelerate drug development, enhance liquid biopsy accuracy, and optimize immunotherapy. CRISPR gene editing and telomere regeneration are also optimized via quantum simulations. Large-scale projects like Peto’s Paradox and Cancer Moonshot focus on AI-quantum computing convergence.

* Immunotherapy: Injecting cancer genetic information into white blood cells for targeted attacks
    
* Telomerase enzyme delivery: Preventing aging without uncontrolled cell proliferation
    
* DNA reprogramming, 3D bioprinting, digital immortality
    

Life expectancy has risen from 30 years (19th century) to 73 years (2020); quantum computers are expected to play a pivotal role in conquering disease and extending human lifespan.

### 4.3 AI, Cryptography, and Security

AI and quantum computers mutually accelerate each other. Sundar Pichai (Google CEO) noted, “AI advances quantum computing, and quantum computing breaks through AI’s limits.” Shor’s algorithm threatens RSA and other cryptosystems, while QKD and laser-based quantum internet represent new security paradigms.

---

### 4.4 Climate, Space, and Nuclear Fusion

Quantum computers offer advanced simulations for climate change, air pollution, and energy optimization. In astrophysics, they enable calculations previously impossible for classical computers, such as the Drake equation, killer asteroids, stellar evolution, and black hole interiors.

## 5\. Quantum Computer Implementation Technologies

| Technology | Principle & Features | Advantages | Disadvantages | Major Companies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Superconducting | Qubits via superconductors at ultra-low temperatures | Leverages existing semiconductor tech, scalable | Requires -273°C, short coherence time | IBM, Google |
| Ion Trap | Trapping ions in vacuum using electric/magnetic fields | Long coherence, precise control | Complex vacuum/control devices, scaling qubits is hard | IonQ, Honeywell |
| Photonic | Uses laser beams, mirrors, beam splitters for photon superposition | Operates at room temp, less environmental impact | Bulky optics, needs rearrangement per problem | Xanadu (Canada) |
| Silicon Photonic | Combines silicon semiconductors and optics | Mass production possible | Early commercialization stage | PsiQuantum, Intel |
| Topological | Utilizes Majorana particles and topological properties | Efficient error correction, high stability | Early research, hard to implement | Microsoft |

Hundreds to thousands of auxiliary qubits per logical qubit are required for error correction. Many technical challenges remain before practical quantum computers are realized.

## 6\. Technical Challenges and Future Outlook

Quantum computers are a technology balancing between **coherence** and **decoherence**. Overcoming decoherence could revolutionize many fields. Interpretations like many-worlds offer new perspectives on reality and information, while Shor’s algorithm and QKD foreshadow major changes in security and social systems. Quantum computers’ greatest strength lies in simulation. Although practical commercialization faces hurdles, their exponential potential could reshape the technological landscape-especially when combined with AI, which may regain exponential growth through quantum computing.
