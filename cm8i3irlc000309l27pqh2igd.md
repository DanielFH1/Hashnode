# Hello, Hashnode!

![If you start Episode III at 11:02:48 PM on New Year's Eve, Obi-Wan will  say, "hello there" at midnight which is a beautiful way to begin 2018. :  r/PrequelMemes](https://external-preview.redd.it/Q_jQKTk88F6ouuVzLOQmP8wqp-1NuuxVNBf8MNVIAsI.jpg?auto=webp&s=95ef5a9553ef21cd0abac88859fd2e04179cb6bf align="left")

Hello! I started a blog on Hashnode because I wanted to write in a place with more users, especially where many developers gather. I have a passion for math, physics, and computer science. I'll probably be sharing new things I learn each day.
